# FindIT: A Smart Lost and Found Management System

Losing something valuable—like your keys, a wallet, or a laptop—is incredibly stressful, especially in a fast-paced campus environment. Currently, most lost and found processes are fragmented, relying on pure luck, scattered social media posts, or physical notice boards with limited reach.

**FindIT** is designed to bridge this gap. We have built a smart, privacy-first platform that centralizes the recovery process. Instead of waiting for a chance encounter, FindIT uses structured data and intelligent matching to reunite people with their belongings quickly and securely.

## Key Features

* ** Smart Matching** Utilizes decision-support logic to automatically compare lost and found reports, flagging potential matches for review.
* ** Privacy Controls** Found item details are kept under restricted visibility to ensure that only the rightful owner can identify and claim them.
* ** Gradual Disclosure** Provides secure communication channels that protect personal contact information until a match is verified by both parties.
* ** Centralized Dashboard** A single source of truth for campus security and administrators to monitor recovery trends and manage high-value items.

## Process

1. **Report:** Users submit a detailed, structured questionnaire for a lost or found item.
2. **Match:** The system analyzes descriptions (color, brand, location, time) to find similarities.
3. **Verify:** The "Gradual Disclosure" process allows the finder to ask clarifying questions without revealing their identity.
4. **Recover:** Once verified, the system facilitates a safe exchange of contact info or a drop-off location.
