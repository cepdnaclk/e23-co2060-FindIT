FindIT: A Smart Lost and Found Management System
Losing something valuable like your keys, a wallet, or a laptop is stressful, especially on a busy campus. Right now, most lost and found processes rely on luck, social media, or checking physical notice boards.

This project, FindIT, changes that. We have built a smart, privacy-first platform that connects people who have lost items with those who have found them. Instead of just hoping for a chance encounter, our system uses structured reporting and intelligent matching to suggest connections. We focus heavily on security, using a gradual disclosure process to prevent fraud and protect user privacy while items are being recovered.

Key Features
Smart Matching: Decision-support logic that flags potential matches between reports.

Privacy Controls: Restricted visibility for found items to ensure only the true owner can claim them.

Gradual Disclosure: Secure communication channels that protect contact information until a match is verified.

Centralized Dashboard: A single source of truth for campus security and administrators.
